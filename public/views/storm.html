                Storm (Ororo Munroe) is a fictional superheroine appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly associated with the X-Men. The character first appeared in Giant-Size X-Men #1 (May 1975),[5] and was created by writer
                    Len Wein and artist Dave Cockrum.
                The daughter of a tribal princess from Kenya, but raised in Harlem and Cairo, Storm is a member of a fictional subspecies of humanity known as mutants, who are
                born with superhuman abilities. Storm has the ability to control the weather and can fly. She is a member of the X-Men, a group of mutant heroes who fight for peace and equality between mutants and humans. Possessing natural leadership
                skills and some of the most formidable powers in her team, Storm has led the X-Men from time to time, and has also been a member of the Avengers and the Fantastic Four. As an adult, Storm married her fellow superhero Black Panther, and
                was by marriage made queen consort of the African nation of Wakanda, but lost this title when they divorced. The character is one of the most prominent X-Men, having appeared in many X-Men incarnations. Storm appears in five installments
                of the live-action X-Men film series, where she is portrayed by actress Halle Berry and by Alexandra Shipp in X-Men: Apocalypse.
